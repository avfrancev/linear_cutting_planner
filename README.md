# Linear cutting planner
### About
The cutting optimization algorithm is an optimization problem that is used to determine the most efficient way to cut a material (such as a sheet of wood or metal) into smaller pieces, according to a list of objects to cut out of the material (such as a list of parts for a piece of furniture). The goal is to minimize the total amount of material wasted during the cutting process. This problem is NP-hard, which means that it is a difficult problem to solve optimally in a reasonable amount of time. The algorithm used to solve this problem is a variant of the bin packing problem, which is a well-known optimization problem in computer science. The specific algorithm used in this project is the First-Fit-Decreasing algorithm, which is a simple and efficient heuristic algorithm that is commonly used to solve this problem.
